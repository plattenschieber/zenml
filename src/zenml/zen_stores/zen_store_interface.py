class ZenStoreInterface(ABC):
    """ZenML store interface.

    All ZenML stores must implement the methods in this interface.

    The methods in this interface are organized in the following way:

     * they are grouped into categories based on the type of resource
       that they operate on (e.g. stacks, stack components, etc.)

     * each category has a set of CRUD methods (create, read, update, delete)
       that operate on the resources in that category. The order of the methods
       in each category should be:

       * create methods - store a new resource. These methods
         should fill in generated fields (e.g. UUIDs, creation timestamps) in
         the resource and return the updated resource.
       * get methods - retrieve a single existing resource identified by a
         unique key or identifier from the store. These methods should always
         return a resource and raise an exception if the resource does not
         exist.
       * list methods - retrieve a list of resources from the store. These
         methods should accept a set of filter parameters that can be used to
         filter the list of resources retrieved from the store.
       * update methods - update an existing resource in the store. These
         methods should expect the updated resource to be correctly identified
         by its unique key or identifier and raise an exception if the resource
         does not exist.
       * delete methods - delete an existing resource from the store. These
         methods should expect the resource to be correctly identified by its
         unique key or identifier. If the resource does not exist,
         an exception should be raised.

    Best practices for implementing and keeping this interface clean and easy to
    maintain and extend:

      * keep methods organized by resource type and ordered by CRUD operation
      * for resources with multiple keys, don't implement multiple get or list
      methods here if the same functionality can be achieved by a single get or
      list method. Instead, implement them in the BaseZenStore class and have
      them call the generic get or list method in this interface.
      * keep the logic required to convert between ZenML domain Model classes
      and internal store representations outside the ZenML domain Model classes
      * methods for resources that have two or more unique keys (e.g. a Workspace
      is uniquely identified by its name as well as its UUID) should reflect
      that in the method variants and/or method arguments:
        * methods that take in a resource identifier as argument should accept
        all variants of the identifier (e.g. `workspace_name_or_uuid` for methods
        that get/list/update/delete Workspaces)
        * if a compound key is involved, separate get methods should be
        implemented (e.g. `get_pipeline` to get a pipeline by ID and
        `get_pipeline_in_workspace` to get a pipeline by its name and the ID of
        the workspace it belongs to)
      * methods for resources that are scoped as children of other resources
      (e.g. a Stack is always owned by a Workspace) should reflect the
      key(s) of the parent resource in the provided methods and method
      arguments:
        * create methods should take the parent resource UUID(s) as an argument
        (e.g. `create_stack` takes in the workspace ID)
        * get methods should be provided to retrieve a resource by the compound
        key that includes the parent resource key(s)
        * list methods should feature optional filter arguments that reflect
        the parent resource key(s)
